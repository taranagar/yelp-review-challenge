That definitely made us feel better. \n\nWe ordered a French Dip, a Geebee Burger, and the potato skins for takeout (back to the comfort in our worldmark condo timeshare).

The interior has an aviation motif with large airplanes hanging down from the cEiling. \n\nOnce we sat down, Brandy was quick to greet us and take our drink order. They have a special going 24/7 for $1 PBR. Pabst might not be the finest beer around, but a dollar is nothing to complain about. Maybe it was the price, or the fact that they serve an ice cold draft in an ice cold pint that makes it that much more enjoyable. \n\nWhen she came back, my friend and I split the Bonnie's BBQ Burger ($7.99) and a Patty Melt ($7.99). The burger was fan-freakin-tastic. A half pound of juicy beef patty cooked to a perfect medium rare stacked with four large onion rings, BBQ sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and three strips of crispy bacon. With the sandwiches you get a choice of fries, onion rings, rice pilaf, potato salad, or some other items. It is ridiculous the variety of sides offered. There is definitely something for everyone. The Patty Melt is served on marbled rye and was good. After biting into the burger, it paled in comparison. We would have been happy with a burger each. I got an order of onion rings with it and they were well seasons, crispy and everything an onion ring should be. It is difficult to find good onion rings because they can be overcooked, doughy, or absorb all the oil. These are the best I have had in a while.\n\nSometimes, I just crave a good burger and some fried goodness. I would be willing to come here again. Especially since they have shuffleboard.

The Onions had a nice sweet flavor to them that went well with the Beer-batter crust....pure awesome!\n\nMy Sliders were pretty good....I wouldn't say they were great, but good.
